    <h3>Write a program that simulates a shopping cart:

        Ask the user to input the total amount.
        
        Use a ternary operator to apply a 15% discount if the total is over $150; otherwise, apply no discount.
        
        Use assignment operators to update the total amount after the discount and log the final price.
        </h3>

        <script>
            var amount = parseInt(prompt("Enter the total amount:"));
            amount > 150 ? console.log("15% discount is applicable"):console.log("No discount");
            amount = amount-((15/100)*amount);
            console.log("Final price = ",amount);
