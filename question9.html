    <h3>Create a program that evaluates a person’s eligibility for a loan. The program should:

        Ask for the person’s age, salary, and credit score.
        
        Use logical operators (&&, ||) to check if the person is eligible for a loan (e.g., age ≥ 21, salary > $30,000, or credit score > 650).
        
        Log whether the person is approved or denied based on these conditions.

            var sal = parseInt(prompt("Enter your salary:"));
